Game similar to Mario.
It needs to be run under Unity and the only button you have to use in order to jump and collect the squares is the space bar.
After finishing the game, the points are shown: they are calculated by the squares you got to collect and the time you stood alive in the game.
If you want to play it again, you have a button for Play again.
